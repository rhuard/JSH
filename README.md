# JSH
Joke Shell

This is a shell that is meant to be a joke... sort of. I will attempt t make this a fully functioning shell that could be useful. But where is the fun in that?

JSH is meant to be a highly customizable shell, but the customizable features will mostly be for shenanigans, not productuvity.

# Why Create a Joke Shell?
Mostly because I wanted a python project, and have always wanted to implement my own shell. So something that does random shenanigans seemed like a good idea... at the time. 

# Shenanigans!!
Right now it is in the inital stages but future plans for shenanigans include:
* randomizing colors for output
* not executing the command you requested all the time
* correcting spelling when spelling is correct

# How to Use
* You will need at least Python 3.3
* clone repo and run main.py

#How to Configure
In the future there will be a .jshrc for you to configure the types and probability of shenanigans and other things such as the prompts. However, that is not implemented yet
