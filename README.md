Joke Shell

This is a shell that is ment to be a joke. A funny tool for messing around. IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE ANYTHING TO DO PRODUCTIVLY.

Right now it is in the inital stages but future plans for shenanigans include:
* randomizing colors for output
* not executing the command you requested all the time
* correcting spelling when spelling is correct
